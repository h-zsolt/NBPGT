### Description

This is a procedural generation tool for Unity that makes use of at current time experimental APIs to create a visual coding style that's easy to expand on and offers great modularity. The generated nodes have a list of components that have a list of dynamic values, this allows the procedurally generated graph to store any kind of information without the need for explicit polymorphic Component classes, but still allows for the implementation of such a system for optimization for specific projects, which may require real-time generation. The tool focuses on modularity and flexibility over speed and memory efficiency.

### Instructions

Developed with Unity version 2021.3.6f1 with a 2022 version in the making. The NBPGT_Graph allows for the creation of a visually coded procedural generation algorithm, which can then be exported to either an object, or as an asset, with support for real-time regeneration planned. The API compatibility level has to be set to .Net Framework due to the use of dynamic variables.

### Learning Outcomes

Use of dynamic variables, understanding the principles behind visual coding, learning about experimental APIs and limitations within Unity and learning about the Reflections API of C#.
